    "text": "3 Protein Overview (chatGPT generated from Uniprot)\nThe mouse Bsep protein (UniProt ID: Q9QY30), encoded by the Abcb11 gene, is known as the bile salt export pump. It is an ATP-binding cassette transporter expressed in the canalicular (apical) membrane of hepatocytes, where it mediates the export of bile salts—bile acids conjugated to amino acids—into bile. Common aliases include BSEP, Bsep, Spgp (sister of P-glycoprotein), and Lith-1. In humans, mutations in the orthologous gene cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2), a name that is also sometimes referenced in research contexts.",
